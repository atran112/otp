This repository contains the files that were used in my ArcGIS StoryMap [here](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/e429dcb90bf042d5af5ac609ae82e963). The only files that are missing from this repository are the osm.pbf files to build the network graph becuase the file sizes are too big. If you want to replicate my analysis, you can download the osm.pbf files [here](https://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/us/california/socal.html), reduce it to only the LA Metro area, and then add it to both the `la_current` and `la_new` folders. My inspiration and understanding of how to perform this analysis comes from this guide [here](https://github.com/marcusyoung/otp-tutorial).
